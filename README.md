# vidScripts_python
Random Python scripts/functions for video processing

These scripts rely on working installation of opencv and other utils. 
Files are either Python 3 or 2 (python2 in filename if <3).

Used to grab playback video onsets from 2 dovelab experiments,
consider as examples for how to batch read info from imgstore files
recorded with dovelab motif.

Workflow notes for Cliodhna:
1. mount share in terminal (command is pinned in slack)
2. use opencv virtual environment
3. ipython
4. import python function by name
5. run main function (fname.main('filedir/to/imgstores'))
6. deactivate
7. copy csv from share to wherever 
8. unmount share
